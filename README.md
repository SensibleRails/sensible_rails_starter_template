./bin/dev
```

## EXAMPLES

Would be nice to have several either included examples or Generators to show the use of the following;
- Stimulus
- Turbo
- RSpec

> if we use examples, they could be namespaces with a cleanup generator to tear them down.

## Docs

Some form of in-app docs space.

- Docs for the usage of this template
- Docs in directories explaining stuff & links to good resources
- Docs where the dev(s) can add their stuff

> Maybe there's a neat lib that can be used
